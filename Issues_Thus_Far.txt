Goals for tomarrow:
set up base agent class X
set up tit for tat, evil, and good agents X

set up basic implementation for main class X
Add game class X
Add visualization
- I want it to show the strategy, each win, and update the score.
so far I show the strategy and update the score
I want to make the memory work for tit-for-tat, its due to it not remembering 'faces', but just having a general memory of neighbors

to work on:
Python not found??? when I run python main.py. (just was not in the environment)
Make agents forget X
Enhance memory, look into hash tables/maps
    only add a memory if it is either unique in general, or different from the last move.
    alternatively, if im using maps, I could redirect the key to the same data.
    Since there can be infinite memories, but finite moves, I could assign a new memory (key) to the same move.
    make the agents hashable
    add score to memory? probably, if I am going to be using it as a benchmark for the agents.
    
modify map to generate empty spaces X
add movement
add score/round X
make it so that agents only play one game against each other
