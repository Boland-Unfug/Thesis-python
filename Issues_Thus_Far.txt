Goals for tomarrow:
set up base agent class X
set up tit for tat, evil, and good agents X

set up basic implementation for main class X
Add game class X
Add visualization
- I want it to show the strategy, each win, and update the score.
so far I show the strategy and update the score
I want to make the memory work for tit-for-tat, its due to it not remembering 'faces', but just having a general memory of neighbors

to work on:
make memory a hash map, where every agent is the key to a move in the dictionary?
